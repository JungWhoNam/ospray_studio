# OSPRay Studio

This is release v0.5.0 of IntelÂ® OSPRay Studio. It is released under the Apache
2.0 license.

## Overview

Intel OSPRay Studio is an open source and interactive visualization and ray
tracing application that leverages [Intel OSPRay](https://www.ospray.org) as
its core rendering engine.  It can be used to load complex scenes requiring
high fidelity rendering or very large scenes requiring supercomputing
resources.

The main control structure is a scene graph which allows users to
create an abstract scene in a generic tree hierarchy. Scenes can either be
imported or created using scene graph nodes and structure support.  The scenes
can then be rendered either with a `pathtracer` or a `scivis` renderer.
 
## Find OSPRay Studio

OSPRay Studio is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Binary packages of the latest release of OSPRay Studio can be downloaded as a
part of [Intel oneAPI Rendering
Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/download.html#renderkit).

OSPRay Studio sources can be downloaded from the default `master` branch of
[OSPRay Studio Github repository](https://github.com/ospray/ospray_studio/).
Download and build instructions for the sources are listed below.
 
## Building OSPRay Studio

OSPRay Studio has the following required and optional dependencies.
 
### Required dependencies

* [CMake](https://www.cmake.org) (v3.1+) and any C++14 compiler
* Intel [OSPRay](https://www.github.com/ospray/ospray) (v2.4.0) and its
  dependencies - OSPRay Studio builds on top of OSPRay. Instructions on
  building OSPRay are provided
  [here](http://www.ospray.org/downloads.html#building-and-finding-ospray)
  * Intel [Open VKL](https://www.github.com/openvkl/openvkl) (v0.11.0)
  * Intel [Embree](https://www.github.com/embree/embree) (v3.8.0)
  * Intel oneAPI Rendering Toolkit common library
    [rkcommon](https://www.github.com/ospray/rkcommon)
  * Intel [Threading Building Blocks](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/)
* OpenGL and [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) (v3.x) - for the windowing
  environment
 
### Optional Dependencies

* Intel [Open Image Denoise](https://openimagedenoise.github.io/) - for
  denoising frames. To use with OSPRay Studio, OSPRay must be built with
  `-DBUILD_OIDN=ON` in CMake
* [OpenImageIO]() and [OpenEXR]() - to support images in a variety of file
  formats. Set `OPENIMAGEIO_ROOT` and `OPENEXR_ROOT` to the respective install
  directories to use these libraries
 
### Building on Linux and macOS

* Follow OSPRay's build instructions to install it, which will also fulfill
  most other required dependencies.  Set the following environment variables to
  easily locate OSPRay, Open VKL, Embree, and rkcommon during CMake.

  ```bash
  export ospray_DIR = ${OSPRAY_INSTALL_LOCATION}
  export openvkl_DIR = ${OPENVKL_INSTALL_LOCATION}
  export embree_DIR = ${EMBREE_INSTALL_LOCATION}
  export rkcommon_DIR = ${RKCOMMON_INSTALL_LOCATION}
  ```
 
* Clone OSPRay Studio

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ospray/ospray_studio/
  ```
 
* Create build directory and change directory to it (we recommend keeping a separate build directory)

  ```bash
  cd ospray_studio
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ```
 
* Then run the typical CMake routine

  ```bash
  cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang ... # or use ccmake
  make -j `nproc` # or cmake --build .
  ```
 
* To run OSPRay Studio, make sure `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (on Linux) or
  `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` (on macOS) contains all dependencies. For example,

  ```bash
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${OSPRAY_INSTALL}/lib64:${OPENVKL_INSTALL}/lib64:...:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  # then run!
  ./ospStudio
  ```
 
### Building on Windows

Use CMake (cmake-gui) to configure and generate a Microsoft Visual Studio
solution file for OSPRay Studio.
 
* Specify the source folder and the build directory in CMake
* Specify `ospray_DIR`, `openvkl_DIR` and `rkcommon_DIR` CMake variables for the
  respective install locations
* Click 'Configure' and select the appropriate generator (we recommend using at
  least Visual Studio 15 2017)
* Select x64 as an optional parameter for the generator (32-bit builds are not
  supported)
* Click 'Generate' to create `ospray_studio.sln`. Open this in Visual Studio and
  compile

You can optionally use the CMake command line:

```pwsh
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
```
 
## Using OSPRay Studio
 
At its core, OSPRay Studio maintains a scenegraph of nodes representing the
current scene as a tree.  This simplifies user interaction with the scene and
hides the maintenance of OSPRay state.  The scenegraph manages the four primary
OSPRay components: the `FrameBuffer`, `Camera`, `Renderer`, and `World`.
OSPRay Studio currently offers three different modes in which it can operate.
You can choose between these modes when launching OSPRay Studio at the command
line.
 
### OSPRay Studio Modes

* **GUI Mode** - `./ospStudio [gui] [file1 [file2 ...]]`

This is the default mode in OSPRay Studio.  Objects can be loaded from command
line or via the UI. This mode provides full control over the scenegraph,
allowing manipulation of the camera, objects, lights, and more. This mode also
allows you to create scene files (.sg files), which can be used to load a full
scene in any mode.
 
* **Batch Mode** - `./ospStudio batch [options] [file1 [file2 ...]]`

This mode provides offline rendering for the objects (or scene file) provided.
For more information on available options, run `./ospStudio batch --help`.
 
* **Timeseries Mode** - `./ospStudio timeseries [options]`

This mode can be used to import timestep volume datasets in raw binary or
OpenVDB formats. This mode is similar to GUI mode but provides extra support
and UI for loading and manipulating time-varying data.
 
### GUI Mode Features

Demo scenes can be loaded in File -> Demo Scene. These are a good starting
point to try out various OSPRay Studio controls.  The Edit menu allows
immediate editing of renderer and frame buffer settings.  The View Menu
contains editors for more complex behaviors, including

* Keyframes for animated camera paths
* Camera snapshots (which can be saved and used across multiple sessions)
* Adding, removing, and manipulating lights in the scene
* Manipulating geometry and materials within the scene

Additionally, GUI mode allows you to save and load scene files (.sg files).
These are JSON-formatted files describing the current scene, including loaded
objects/data, lights, and camera state.  Scene files are human-readable and
editable. Note that they do not include the actual data of objects in the
scene, but rather instruct OSPRay Studio to load and transform the specified
objects.

## Extending OSPRay Studio

OSPRay Studio can be customized in various ways, including widgets for UI
controls, plugins for application behavior, importers for file type support,
and generators for creating new data.
 
### Widgets

A widget is a GUI component. It is not necessarily a part of the MainWindow by
default, but can be included for providing controls for special
scenes/datasets. For example, the `AnimationWidget` can be used to provide
animation controls for an animated scene. Widgets are implemented as separate
classes, which can be instanced in the MainWindow class for loading the special
controls.

### Plugins

A plugin is a CMake subproject that enhances the functionality of OSPRay
Studio. Plugins may be individually selected to build in CMake. They can then
be individually chosen to load at runtime on the command line.  An example
plugin is provided to demonstrate how to create new plugins. To test it, enable
plugins and the example plugin in CMake, then run:

```
./ospStudio -p example
```
 
### Importers

OSPRay Studio comes with support for glTF and OBJ/MTL formats for geometry
data. It supports raw binary and OpenVDB formats for volumetric data.
Additional importers may be added via plugins by extending OSPRay Studio's
`importerMap`.

### Generators for scene graph

The generator API can be used to create data and node hierarchies
programmatically.  OSPRay Studio comes with a set of sample generators for
reference. A new generator class is created by inheriting from the main
Generator class and writing a `generateData()` method to specify the node
hierarchy.
